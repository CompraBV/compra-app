Extension list:

- Extension list is loaded in from JSON.
- Extension list is intercepted before loading into the TableLayout to be sorted
- Extension list is loaded into the TableLayout

Domain list when searched:

- Domain list is loaded in from the JSON along with the searched for domain Domain object
- domainSearchedFor Domain object will be excluded from sorting since it has top priority
- All the rest is in applicationExtensionList (I think so atleast) and is intercepted to be loaded
- applicationExtensionLit is loaded into the TableLayout
